# Cooking

## Features

### Grocery generation

Users can set up a list of all the meals they intend to consume during the week.
This comprehends breakfast, launch, and dinner, and additional snacks.
Moreover, the user can also select a set of week days in which it is available
to go and buy groceries.

The AI assistant then takes over, generating a groceries list for each of the
selected days, so that what's bought will fulfill the whole preparation of the
days-after meals, ingredient-wise.

### Suggestions creation

Often times people forget to plan ahead what to eat, and what's home feels
either insufficient or unenjoyable.
It is possible for users to prompt the AI assistant telling which ingredients
are available in the house, for then receiving a set of possible meal ideas
plausible to prepare and eat.

## Usage

The user will be able to use the app via the browser, and therefore it must be
connected to the internet to be able to interact with the AI assistant, and to
view its data.
A minimal UI will provide easy access to the main sections/pages:

- a page for inserting the week's meals and generating/viewing the groceries
  list;
- a page for inserting which ingredients the user has available and for then
  requesting meal ideas;
- a page for inserting extra info about user's eating habits and for performing
  other account actions.
